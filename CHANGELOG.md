Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- OpenSSF Scorecard workflow and badge.
- `copilot-instructions.md` for consistent AI-assisted contributions.
- Coverage reporting in CI (cargo-tarpaulin).
- Split the README's security/CI badges onto their own line, separate from the platform/tech/AI badges (they were rendering as a single merged line).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-18

First stable release: a real, packaged, installable distribution exists
for macOS, Windows, and Linux (DMG, EXE installer, deb/rpm, AppImage),
the prerequisite for a 1.0 release per this portfolio's own SemVer
discipline.

## [0.2.9] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- README/README.de: marked Ollama as "(optional, for AI-assisted
  sorting)": core scan/hash/dedup/move already work without it.

## [0.2.8] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- Documented the EN/DE language toggle in README.md/README.de.md; it was already implemented and working but not mentioned.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Removed em-dashes/en-dashes across ARCHITECTURE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and several Rust source comments/string literals (Swiss German orthography rule).
- Removed stale scaffold-tool bookkeeping files SKELETON.md and TEMPLATE_NOTES.md.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-07-12

### Security

- Rewrote SECURITY.md to the portfolio's current standard (GitHub Security Advisory reporting, 48h response target, Latest-only supported version; the previous version incorrectly said "0.1.x" was supported).
- Documented a Dependabot-flagged advisory (glib, transitive via Tauri's Linux GTK bindings) as an accepted, time-boxed exception.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`): builds and attaches macOS (DMG), Windows (NSIS installer), and Linux (AppImage) bundles to a GitHub Release on every tag push. Previously, no release ever had an installer attached.
- README/README.de.md: Download section linking to the latest release's installers.

### Security

- Bumped `vite` (v5 to v8) and `@vitejs/plugin-react` (v4 to v6) together to resolve a Dependabot-flagged advisory (esbuild dev-server request/response exposure). Dev-server only, does not affect the built application. Also added `esbuild` as an explicit dev dependency: Vite 8 no longer bundles it by default, and this project's `vite.config.ts` explicitly requests `minify: 'esbuild'`.

### Fixed

- All GitHub Actions in `ci.yml` pinned to a commit SHA, matching the portfolio's Action Pinning standard.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- SemVer correction: v0.1.1 added a genuine new feature (full English/German UI with a language toggle) but was versioned as a patch. Renumbered v0.1.1 through v0.1.4 to v0.2.0 through v0.2.3 (same commits, tags and releases recreated at identical SHAs), per the portfolio's SemVer discipline (patch = fix, minor = feature, major = finished product).
- Removed an eszett (ß) from TEMPLATE_NOTES.md; the project uses Swiss German orthography (ss, not ß).
- Removed em-dashes from TEMPLATE_NOTES.md's file list.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Documented Dual-Licensing assessment (Community-only) in ROADMAP.md.

### Fixed

- Removed em-dashes from ROADMAP.md and SECURITY.md.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Updated actions/setup-node to its latest major version in CI, since GitHub is deprecating the Node.js 20 runtime and the previous version was being forced onto Node 24 and crashing during post-run cleanup.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-10

### Changed

- Moved the "New here? -> beginners guide" callout in README.md above Features (previously only appeared near Requirements)

### Added

- Added the "New here?" beginner guide callout to README.de.md (was missing)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed
- App crashed on every launch: `main.rs` called `tokio::runtime::Handle::current()` from inside Tauri's synchronous `setup()` closure, which has no active Tokio context; switched to `tauri::async_runtime::block_on()`
- Missing `sqlx` workspace dependency and missing Tauri icon set (caused a `generate_context!` panic)
- CI excluded the `lifesort-tauri` crate from check/clippy/test, so these issues went undetected; CI now covers the full workspace plus a new frontend typecheck/build job
- CSS `@import` ordering issue
- LICENSE copyright line formatting

### Added
- Full English/German UI with a language toggle (English default, German switchable)
- Onboarding sections in README: how the app runs, in-practice summary, uninstall/cleanup steps
- Real EN/DE screenshots of the running app

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Recursive file scanner for arbitrary source directories
- AI classifier via local Ollama model (photos, documents, media recognition)
- Duplicate detection using hash comparison
- Folder structure generator: Photos/People/Places/Events, Documents/Invoices/Contracts/Taxes, Downloads/Installers/Archives, Media/Videos/Audio
- One-click execute with full undo support (SQLite undo log)
- Tauri v2 desktop shell with React/TypeScript frontend
